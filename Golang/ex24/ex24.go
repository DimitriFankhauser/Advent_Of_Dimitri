Congratulations, you've made it!
I hope you had as much fun going through this challenge as I had making it.
Christmas is a time to be at home, eat amazing food and play board games
I know it's technically more of a role-playing game, than a traditional board game but one of these games could be dungeons and dragons
Dungeons and Dragons or DnD in short is a game where you go through a dungeon, fight monsters, gain gold etc.
If you like this idea, now is the time for you to build your own RPG in a console!

Feel free to direct any feedback regarding the challenge to adventofdimitri@gmail.com
I have created a bit of sample-code for you to get started. Have fun and Merry Christmas


Next year we'll do this in COBOL, what do you think?
