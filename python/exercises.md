# How to use this repo
- under [exercises](./exercises) you will find several smaller and larger challenges
- they are not exactly tailored to a specific university-course. They should simply be a fun and challenging tool for your coding-journey
- in the directories you will find a file for you to code in (ex) and a file with tests. If these tests all run correctly, you solved this challenge :)
