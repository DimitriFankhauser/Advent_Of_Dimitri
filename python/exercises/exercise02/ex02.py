# okay now that we've done the warm-up, let's do some small things with parameters
# This main-function will be used to calculate volatage according to ohm's law (U=R * I)
# you receive two parameters, r for resistance AND i for intensity/current.
# validate the input (no negative values) and return the voltage
# if you receive an invalid input, return -1 instead of the calculation
