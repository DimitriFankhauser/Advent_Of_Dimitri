# now that we've established some basic class-knowledge, let's take it to another level!
# Your task now is the following. Some elves are lactose-intolerant.
# To accommodate them we'd like to know who can and who can't have dairy in their Christmas dinner.
# Your task now is to copy the Elf-Class into this folder. Add a field "lactose_intolerant" to it and recreate the elf-object from ex13.
# Add the information, that Sparkles is lactose intolerant to it
