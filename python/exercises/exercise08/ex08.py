# Like every modern company Santa Clause LLC also has their employees (elves) in a computer system.
# However the elves got confused about their lists.
# They have a list of elves stored in their system, which likely contains duplicates.
# Read the list from the file elves.txt and make sure they haven't stored anyone twice
# Remove the duplicates and write them into elves_unique.txt
# As in ex07 there will be a unit-test, that you can run, to recreate the original list, in case you make a mistake or would like to redo the challenge

# Hint: Python has a really cool data-structure that you can use for this
