# The elves are working very hard to build and package all the presents for the nice kids.
# Some presents take up more space than others, which is why they need to be packaged in smaller and bigger crates (this would be way funnier, if this challenge were written in Rust)
# In Example a Candybar (7 letters) takes up more space than bunny (5 letters)
# Now that we can read input from files, we will also write to files. You will receive a list of Presents by reading from the presents.txt.
# If the present takes up a lot of space (>5 letters), write them into the file big_crates.txt. If they take up less space write them into the list small_crates.
# If you run into trouble or want to reset the challenge, run the unit-test "reset-challenge" in sol07
# The elves thank you for your service
