# Dictionaries can be really helpful to map values to their respective definition.
# As Christmas is coming up Bernard, the Head Elf is already planning the Christmas dinner. The seats in the big hall are numbered.
# Certain elves want to sit next to each other, while others don't want to sit next to each other.
# Bernard can't cater to everyone's wishes, so he assigns the seats randomly.
# Task: you receive a list of elves and randomly assign a seat to each elf. Return a dictionary in the form of <elf-name>:<seat>
# Throw an exception if the list you receive is empty
