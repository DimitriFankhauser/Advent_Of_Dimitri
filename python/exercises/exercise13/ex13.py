# A Class is a "blueprint" for a data-object. Meaning:
# In a class you may define how your data is supposed to look like.
# Classes have different reasons for their existence: mostly to achieve a certain behaviour or to store data in a way that makes sense
# have a look at the elf-class in Elf.py
# Your task is to create a single elf-object from the class with the following properties:
# id=24
# name= Sparkles
# balance= 24.12
#
