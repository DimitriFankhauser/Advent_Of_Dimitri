# Tiny intermezzo from the christmassy challenges: no matter which IDE you're using now is the time to look up how to use
# the debugger.
# This skill will help you incredibly for some of the harder problems this challenge and any kind of coding has to offer
# Use the debugger to find out which numbers are present in the nums.txt file and write them into the numbers_found array by hand.
# No need to modify anything else. If you haven't used the debugger so far, go back to the previous challenges and see what this mighty tool can do for you
