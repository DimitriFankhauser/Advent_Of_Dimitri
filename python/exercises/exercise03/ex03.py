# Loops & Comparisons:
# It's halloween. There is a killer clown who has a list of all people in Clownsville with him.
# The list only contains first names. The clown gives you his list as a list of strings like so ["Hans", "Malcom", "Charlie"]
# Today the killer clown only kills Hans to still his bloodlust. Remove Hans from the list and return the rest
# In this challenge Hans will only be present in the list ONCE
