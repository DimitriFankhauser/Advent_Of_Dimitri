# Santa is ready to go deliver some presents, but his reindeer are scattered around the north-pole.
# Some are in the factory, looking for snacks
# Some are outside, glancing at the stars
# And a few are even by the fireplace enjoying the cozy warmth.
# Collect them all and sort them alphabetically, so Santa can bridle them for their work
# Throw an error, if you can't find them all (there are 9)
