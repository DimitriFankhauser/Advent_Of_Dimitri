# Advent of Dimitri 

Sooo... I have a couple of friends who want to get better at Coding.

And I'm also very passionate about programming. 

Lastly I want to spend more time improving my abilities at Golang. 

Since christmas is approaching now seems to be an appropriate time to do my very own advent of code. 
Challenges will more than likely not be updated every day. 


## Who is Dimitri and what is Advent of Dimitri?
Dimitri? that's me. End of story. 
Advent of Dimitri? Advent of Dimitri is a very simple challenge, that I am creating for a couple of friends. It's neither about perfect code nor is it about _really hard problems_. This is just basic coding 101 and more about having fun coding, than anything else, really. 
The problems will be posed in Python, as that is the most requested language. There will be some unit-tests included to check the most important cases, but I don't aim for 100% code coverage. 
The solutions will be created in Golang, because that is the language I want to improve at. Also that way, if you struggle, you can still read out the basic steps needed, but also enjoy the satisfaction of solving the problems yourself. 

## How does this work? Who is this for?

As mentioned before, this is for people who have exams to pass or who would like some brainfood. 
If you don't know git and don't have an intrinsic urge to learn it right now download this repo as a zip-archive. Unpack it and let's get coding. Whenever there is a new challenge that you'd like to do download the files. Put them in the correct directory and have fun coding :) 
Instructions for running the tests can [here]('python/instructions.md')
